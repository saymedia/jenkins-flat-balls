Flat Balls For Jenkins
======================

This Jenkins plugin replaces the "ball" icons that are used to indicate project
status with new images that have more of a flat style.

The images also incorporate non-color-based indication of status so that they
are usable by people with red/green color blindness.

This plugin is based on the "Green Balls" plugin.
